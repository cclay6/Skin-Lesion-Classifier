# Skin-Lesion-Classifier
Designed and trained two skin lesion classifiers using a pretrained Alexnet CNN, transfer learning, and different training and image augmentation parameters, and tested their robustness using pristine, noisy, and denoised images.

Files:
- Matlab live script: Skin_Lesion_Classifier.mlx
- Function for changing size of image to expected size for Alexnet: readAndPreprocessImage.m

Dataset: Skin lesion images are from ISIC dataset (source: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/) and are labeled as benign or malignant.
